### How to use Locally

<b>Note:</b> You can create a virtual environment to install the dependencies in a local folder.

First, you need to clone the repo

```bash
git clone https://github.com/heccubernny/meato.git
```

then, move into the directory

```bash
cd meato
```

then, install the dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

then, run the program

```bash
python manage.py runserver
```

then, go to the url that is given to you

## optional

You can generate dummy data for testing purposes

run the following command in your root directory
i.e (same directory as your manage.py file)

```bash
python createFakeData.py
```
